> [!WARNING]
> `bpy_jupyter` has reached a state of tentative usability, and should be considered **beta software** aka. **still unstable**.
> 
> - The UI/UX may have unsolved frustrations and confusions.
> - The documentation may be incomplete or unwritten.
> - Tests, if they exist, have no guarantees of coverage or passing.
> 
> We already personally find the `main` branch of `bpy_jupyter` **quite useful**, and we invite you to give it a try.
> _Above all else, please be patient with us at this early stage._



## Highlights
- **Blender 💗 Jupyter**: Jupyter is fantastic at reproducibly mangling data. Blender is fantastic at visualization. _It's a perfect match!_
- **Minimalistic**: This extension does one thing well: Manages a Jupyter kernel embedded in Blender. _No bundled client, no opionionated servers, just a kernel!_
- **Ready to Use**: Confused how to use this? We've written extensive user guides to help you achieve compelling results.
- 🌐 **Respects your Freedoms**: `bpy_jupyter` preserves your freedom to use, modify, fork, redistribute, or even sell `bpy_jupyter`, **so long as you extend the same freedoms as you were granted** under the [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) software license. _For more details, see our [License Policy](https://docs.sofus.io/bpy_jupyter/stable/reference/policies/licensing.html)._

## Acknowledgements
**The authors hope that you find this software useful.**

Firstly, this would not be possible without the entire [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) community, across forums, DevTalk, Matrix chats, and so much more.

Secondly, credit goes to Jan Hendrik Müller for discovering just how powerful Jupyter could be in Blender, then building on that idea to create very cool demos and novel workflows.
Please go watch his [BCon24 talk](https://youtu.be/umS8jFXpC-o?feature=shared)!

We deeply value the opportunity to show an early demo of `bpy_jupyter` to the Jupyter server team, who let us come to [their meeting](https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass/issues/73#issuecomment-2610204937) and ask for some key feedback.

Finally, we encourage you to peruse our `uv tree` of dependencies.
We stand on the shoulders of giants, and could not hope to see so far without.
