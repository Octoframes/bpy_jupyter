# `bpy_jupyter`
_NOTE: This software should be considered alpha aka. **unstable**. It is not ready for production use. The documentation is still very sparse._

_With that said, we already find it **quite useful**. We hope you'll consider sharing your experiences with us, good and bad - for example, in the Discussions / Issues sections!_

A [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) extension making it easy to interact with `bpy` using `jupyter` notebooks.



## Features
- **Blender ðŸ’— Jupyter**: Use Blender's Python API, `bpy`, directly from Jupyter notebooks.
- **Easy to Get Going**: One click to launch Jupyter Lab in your browser, and you're ready to write notebooks with Blender.
	We want it to be incredibly easy to start playing around.
- **Beautiful Data-Viz**: The flexibility of notebook-based data-viz, with the visual appeal of modern computer graphics software.
	The popular [BCon24 talk](https://youtu.be/umS8jFXpC-o?feature=shared&t=81) is only the tip of the iceberg.
- **Your Favorite IDE**: Launch the built-in Jupyter Lab in a browser with one click.
	Or, connect using your favorite Jupyter client / IDE, ex. [`VSCodium`](https://vscodium.com/#why)!



## Installing `bpy_jupyter`
The following installation methods are supported / planned:

- `extensions.blender.org`: **Planned, not yet implemented**. When done, one can install the extension directly from the official Blender extension website.
- **Install from Release**: **Planned, not yet implemented**. When done, one can install the extension by downloading a `.zip` file from the `Releases` section, then drag-and-dropping it into Blender's UI.
- **Install from Source**: Relatively simple command-line based installation, directly from this source repository.

### Installing from Source
**First**, ensure that `git` and the `uv` package manager are installed.

- `git`: See <https://git-scm.com/>.
- `uv`: See <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>.

Then, find a folder you're allowed to write to, and open a terminal within it.
Within this terminal, execute the following three lines:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Octoframes/bpy_jupyter.git
cd bpy_jupyter
uvx blext build  ## No need to install anything; 'uv' handles everything.
```

This will build the extension for your current platform using the `blext` package manager for Blender extensions.

One finished, an installable `.zip` file will be available in `./dev/build/bpy_jupyter__<version>_<platform>.zip`.
Simply drag-and-drop this file into a running Blender window to install the extension.



## Using `bpy_jupyter`
After installing the extension, go to the `Properties -> Scene` panel.
Here, you will find:

- **Jupyter Options**: There are various options, from basic to advanced. Hover over an option to see a more in-depth explanation.
- **Start/Stop Buttons**: At the bottom of the panel, the are buttons to start and stop the jupyter server.

To start the Jupyter server, press the `Start Jupyter` button.
If the browser icon is highlighed, then your default browser will open to the Jupyter Lab IDE.

### The First Notebook
In the automatically launched Jupyter Lab, create a notebook with the default `ipython` kernel.

Then, try running the following code cell:

```python
import bpy
bpy.data.objects
```

If this works, then Blender is now being driven from a notebook!
For more ideas, see: <https://kolibril13.github.io/bpy-gallery/>.


### Jupyter Options
`Root Dir` selects the folder within which Jupyter Lab will start.
**Notebook files outside of this folder cannot be run** by Jupyter Lab.

Currently, `Kernel` selects the underlying kernel software that will interface with Blender.
In the future, [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) is planned as an option.

In the `Network` subpanel, `IP` and `Port` may be selected.
These will not usually need to be changed; however, depending on local network policies, it may be important and/or desirable to do so in special environments.



## Important Limitations and Gotchas
There are a few important things to note about this system:

- **The kernel cannot be interrupted, restarted, or shut down from Jupyter Lab**.
_Attempting to do so may break the system_.
This limitation may be solved in the future, but currently it is absolute.
To restart the kernel, _everything_ (including Jupyter Lab) must be restarted by pressing the `Stop Jupyter` button, then the `Start Jupyter` button.
- **Different kernels will share the same variables and process**.
This limitation may be solved in the future, but would require rearchitecting the extention.
For now, it is suggested to use one notebook at a time, to avoid "variable bleed".
