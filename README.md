> [!WARNING]
> `bpy_jupyter` has reached a state of tentative usability, and should be considered **beta software** aka. **still unstable**.
> 
> - The UI/UX may have unsolved frustrations and confusions.
> - The documentation may be incomplete or unwritten.
> - Tests, if they exist, have no guarantees of coverage or passing.
> 
> We already personally find the `main` branch of `bpy_jupyter` **quite useful**, and we invite you to give it a try.
> _Above all else, please be patient with us at this early stage._



## Highlights
- **Blender 💗 Jupyter**: Jupyter is fantastic at reproducibly mangling data. Blender is fantastic at visualization. _It's a perfect match!_
- **Minimalistic**: This extension does one thing well: Manages a Jupyter kernel embedded in Blender. _No bundled client, no opionionated servers, just a kernel!_
- **Ready to Use**: Confused what exactly to do? We've written extensive user guides to help you achieve compelling results.
- 🌐 **Respects your Freedoms**: `bpy_jupyter` preserves your freedom to use, modify, fork, redistribute, or even sell `bpy_jupyter`, **so long as you extend the same freedoms as you were granted** under the [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) software license. _For more details, see our [License Policy](https://sorose-bpy-jupyter.pgs.sh/reference/policies/licensing.html)._

Thanks to the Jupyter server team, who let us present an early demo of `bpy_jupyter` at [their meeting](https://github.com/jupyter-server/team-compass/issues/73#issuecomment-2610204937), and provided some great feedback.

Finally, please peruse our `uv tree` of dependencies.
We stand on the shoulders of giants, and could not hope to see so far without.
