# Licensing
!!! abstract "Disclaimer"
	We are not lawyers, and a such, everything written here might be hogwash.

	If in doubt, please refer to the `LICENSE` file in the repository root and/or your own legal council.

`bpy_jupyter` is distributed under the [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) software license, and has **absolutely no warranty**.

!!! question "Does `bpy_jupyter` come with a warranty or other support?"
	`bpy_jupyter` has **absolutely no warranty**, nor any guarantee of support.

	If you wish to arrange for commercial support, ex. in the form of workshops or specific featuers, please contact the authors/maintainers.
	We would be more than happy to work out a fair solution.

!!! question "My organization prohibits the AGPL! What do I do?"
	**If the license is stopping you** from using `bpy_jupyter`, then **tell us** via email / an Issue!

	We're confident that we can work out a fair solution that allows you to use `bpy_jupyter`.





## Why AGPL?
The AGPL guarantees your right to use, modify, fork, redistribute, **or even sell `bpy_jupyter`**, in whole or in part.
The AGPL also guarantees your right to ask for the source code. [^1]

[^1]: For convenience, you can find the source code here: <https://github.com/Octoframes/bpy_jupyter>.

What's the catch?
If you **give someone** `bpy_jupyter`, _including via a network service_, then you **must extend the same rights** as you yourself were given by applying a compatible license.

We think that's pretty fair.

!!! question "Can I copy code from `bpy_jupyter` / link to `bpy_jupyter` from other projects?"
	**Absolutely** - so long as you extend the same freedoms you were given by `bpy_jupyter`.

	In practice, the license of that "other project" must be compatible with the AGPL license of `bpy_jupyter`, since it is now a "derivative work".

	For example, the following (non-exclusive) kinds of projects that use `bpy_jupyter` would be required to have a license compatible with the AGPL:
	
	- A web service that uses `bpy_jupyter` to sell a "Jupyter in Blender" service.
	- An extension that copied a function from `bpy_jupyter`, to provide its own functionality.

!!! question "Do I have to make internal `bpy_jupyter`-based tools public?"
	**Absolutely not**.
	The AGPL only applies on _distribution_.

	If you don't give your `bpy_jupyter`-based tool to third partiers, then no third party may claim any AGPL-protected rights to `bpy_jupyter`.

!!! question "Are the dependencies of `bpy_jupyter` also AGPL?"
	**Absolutely not**, since that's not our code!

	Please refer to the relevant dependencies for license details.

!!! question "Can I really sell `bpy_jupyter`?"
	**Absolutely!**

	So long as you adhere to the terms of the license, including ex. granting users access to the source code (including modifications), you are free to sell `bpy_jupyter`.

	We consider this ability to be a fundamental _software freedom_.
